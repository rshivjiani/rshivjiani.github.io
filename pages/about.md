# Welcome to The Frenzy!

###### Previously U.S. Frenzy

The Frenzy is run by Rahil Shivjiani. Even though he might seem young, he has the journalistic ability to blow many people away. He has been credited on his mature work by his friends, family, and others.

## A Note from the Founder...

Howdy! My name is Rahil Shivjiani, founder and journalist of the The Frenzy. Even though The Frenzy has been THIS particular site's first name, The Frenzy was not always "The Frenzy". Let's take a step back in history (a.k.a. 2012).

The Frenzyâ€™s very first name was NFL Frenzy. NFL Frenzy was founded in 2012 by me, but it was not all me. Since I was in the single digits when this blog was created, I needed some help starting this blog. I have to extremely thank my cousin, [Ravi](http://new.raviudeshi.com/), who helped me create this blog and has been helping me from the beginning. I created NFL Frenzy because I love football, and I wanted to use my football knowledge and create a journalistic blog where I write about football new.

After a few years, my interests shifted a little, and I started to like more things, including politics, technology, and more. So, I decided to change my blog name to U.S. Frenzy, so I can have more bandwidth for my blogging. I changed my blog name on my old blog, which was hosted on Tumblr and started writing a lot about politics and sports.

As a person who is interested a lot in technology, and especially coding, I decided to go to the next level with my interests. So, I took the initiative to hand-code my own blog. Once again, I have to thank my cousin, Ravi, for inspiring me to take this initiative. He told me all about the power of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and GitHub pages, and how much you can do with coding. He knew much about this because his [current site](http://new.raviudeshi.com/) is run by Jekyll. I was kind of comfortable with the customizable features of Tumblr, but I wanted to do something more. Something that I can say that I made! So, finally I went into the rabbit hole of writing code. Markdown, HTML, CSS..., the list goes on.

After grueling work of moving all my posts from Tumblr to GitHub, I finally made this blog my main blog, and now I write about more things and appeal to other people. Today, The Frenzy blogs regularly about news today.
