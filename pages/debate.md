**RAHIL SHVJIANI / MARCH 10, 2016**

Tonight, this debate will be important for all candidates. This will the determine the face of this race. This debate is going to determine how many candidates will be in the race after next Tuesday. In this article, I will list the airing information for this debate, what question(s) are probably going to be asked, and what are we going to expect from this debate.

### ISSUE TALK

Many issues will be discussed in tonight's debate, like always. Although, on issue would be the core of this debate.

- **IMMIGRATION IDEAS:** This is the same prediction I made yesterday for the Democratic Debate. I believe that there are many Hispanics in the state of Florida, especially Miami, and the candidates have to appeal to them. Yesterday, you saw a couple of people from the audience talk about their immigration horror story, and they asked the candidates what they will do to fix it. I believe the same will happen today. The person who has to appeal the most to these voters are Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Donald Trump has called to build a wall, and be flexible if needed. He also wants to grant amnesty to law-abiding illegal immigrants when they come back legally. Ted Cruz, on the other hand, has some work to do. He has called on not to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants. This will be a heated topic in the debate tonight.

### WHAT TO EXPECT

As mentioned, tonight's debate is important for all the candidates. They need to appeal to many voters before next Tuesday before five states vote, including the winner-take-all, Florida. Here are some things we can see tonight.

- **ATTACK FRENZY:**
  - This has been a big thing in all debates, and it is baffling. Rubio has shown his dark side throughout this month, and now we have to see if Trump acts back. If Trump wants to appeal to Florida voters, he has to act a little more presidential tonight. Although, this might be a bit of a slugfest.
- **APPEALING TIME!**
  - This is the time for all the candidates, especially Marco Rubio and John Kasich, to appeal to voters tonight. Marco Rubio, who is debating on his home turf, is losing in the polls. In the recent CNN/ORC poll, it shows Trump at 40%, and Rubio at 24%. That is very bad news for Marco Rubio. He has to show that he is the candidate that can beat Donald Trump, and he sure can't do that with a 16 point deficit in a trustworthy poll. John Kasich is not looking to hot either. In Ohio, Trump holds 41%, while Kasich holds 35%. Not as bad as Rubio, but if Trump wins both Ohio and Florida, John Kasich and Marco Rubio might have to drop out, which will make it a two-man race. Rubio has to fold before it is too late. He can endorse Ted Cruz, and potentially stop Donald Trump. Although, as we saw on Tuesday on the Democratic side, polls can lie!

This is the last time that some candidates can appeal to the voters of the five states voting next Tuesday. Just today, CNN said that Ben Carson will be endorsing Donald Trump tomorrow, Friday the 11th. It might not get him a lot more votes (than he already has), but it can advance his lead.

Happy Watching!
