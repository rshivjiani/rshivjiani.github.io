It's that time of year again. Where the innovation takes place[^1]. This is time when the top most technology companies in the world open the curtain of new technology to the world. For example, Google did their annual *Google i/o* in May. Watching that keynote made me think that Apple is way behind in the world of technology. For example, we are still overdue for another day Mac[^2]. Also, even though the iPhone SE is popular in Asian countries, America is not feeling the hype (according to me). Along with that, the iPad Pro isn't gaining as much popularity
as Apple was projected to get. Finally, the sales for the Apple Watch didn't meet their sky-rocket projection for 10 million dollars. This all comes down to their decline of sales in April.

So, here comes WWDC 16. Apple's biggest opportunity to save themselves from a world from hell. People are looking for a big change in the iPhone and the iPad. Not just a bigger screen or size. I will be writing a another post about how Apple can improve with their products.

But now, I'm talking about WWDC. Apple is projected to release a new MacOS, iOS, WatchOS, and tvOS, according to [MacRumors.com](http://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/). Since there has been much buzz about the new iOS, I will release leaks and my wishes for iOS 10.

Into the rabbit hole we go!

### Leaks!

The iOS 10 leaks sound promising. But, there are only a couple of leaks, according to MacRumors.com. So, without further ado, let's take a peek at those leaks...

**Redesigned Apple Music App**

- Apple is rumored to be coming out with a simpler, but powerful Apple Music update. They seem to be putting emphasis on black & white backgrounds, and highlight album artwork.
- Apple may replace the New Tab feature in the app with a Browse option which includes better tools to find more music.
- Connect and Beats 1 would stay the same, but according to MacRumors.com, they are expected to remove the "Connect" tab from the app's interface.

**Siri SDK**

- This is one I've been wanting for a long time. Siri integration with 3rd party apps. This will enable more bandwidth for developers, as they can make their apps better with Siri Integration. I use the texting app, [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) a lot for family updates, and having Siri SDK would make my (and my family's) user experience way better. Imagine saying to Siri to text an update to my family.

**Apple Pay in web browsers.**

- This will allow people to order things on iOS devices faster. I have seen how frustrating it is to enter credit card information *EVERY SINGLE TIME* from my parents! To ease the pain, Apple may unveil Apple Pay in web browsers this Monday. This will definitely make ordering things of the web much more user-friendly.

**App Store Improvements! Yes please!**

*This is amazing. Ever since the App Store was launched not long after the iPhone came out, everyone knew this was revolutionizing to smartphones. We can now watch videos, play games, and also read books on our iOS devices thanks to the App Store. Now, Apple is making big changes to the App Store. Here are a few.*

-	Apple has opened up app subscriptions to include allows all product categories and introduced a new revenue split. You can read more about this [here](http://www.macrumors.com/2016/06/08/apple-major-app-store-changes/(http://www.macrumors.com/2016/06/08/apple-major-app-store-changes/).
- Apple has also adding ads to the App Store search results.
- They are also improving the Featured section. Now, apps that have already been installed won't show up. This enables a more user-friendly experience when installing apps.
- Apple is also rumored to bring back the Categories section.
- A share sheet option is being added as a 3D Touch option.

**iMessage for Android**

-	I know this isn't an iOS leak, but it is still important. Android users can now use iMessage as a default app. iMessage won't let anyone add a person to a group chat, because of the lack of capability (really Google) Also, you can't name group chats, which is sometimes frustrating. This enables a new level of versatility between iOS devices and Android devices.

### Wishes

There are many wishes that I desire. In this part, I will break down by app/importance. Here they are:

#### System Improvements

**Screenshare:** This one is a biggie. This one was the first wish I had on my wishlist. I remember I was talking with my cousin, and we both thought to ourselves, "Wouldn't it be nice to have a screenshare capability on the iPad." And then a lightbulb turned on. And now here we are! This could be the new TeamViewer or GoToMeeting for the iPad. This could also be supported during FaceTime.

**Gaming Sharing:** This one I got from a friend. He, and many others, love gaming. And the best thing for gamers is to have is a recording feature. This could tie in with the Screenshare feature I mentioned above. I believe this feature would be the future for Apple and gamers!

**Night-Shift Changes:** I really loved the night-shift feature when it came out. I just started
using the app [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) not long before it was unveiled, and it was awesome. When night-shift came out though, I noticed some problems. One, it goes directly to the warmer side of the spectrum when on a schedule. On the other hand, f.lux transitions slowly to the warmer side of the spectrum. I really hope they fix that.

**Alternative to the "sleepy feature:"** I like to call night-shift the "sleepy feature". Even though this feature has been a hit, some people just don't favor this. The alternative to this is a dark mode. People find this also easier on the eyes when reading, coding, and just simply using a device. I know I do. I would like to see this implemented in the near future.

**Lock-screen complications:** This is one of the few reasons I prefer Samsung over Apple. Having the complications on the Apple Watch has been great. To step it up a notch, there are also 3rd party complications. Now, let's take a step back and bring it over to the MAIN os.

**Customizable Control Center:** I like the control center and all, but seriously. I can bet many people would like to see a bigger, more user-friendly control center.

**Multi-tasking with own app:** Imagine wanting to work with two Word documents at the same time. Well guess what, you can't! Let's do it Apple!

**Folders *INSIDE* Folders:** I really like to organized. And, I like to have a one page full of apps. And example of this could be having a Google, Microsoft, iCloud... folder inside a productivity folder.

**Support for Mice:** This is the big cheese. I would really want an mouse for my iOS devices, so I can really treat it like a netbook. This could also be helpful for people who use an iPad as their main device (like me).

#### Phone

**Banner Notifications for calls:** This is one that Daring Fireball writer [John Gruber](https://twitter.com/gruber/status/481838111090298880) has been wishing for a long time. He is not alone. My cousin, Ravi, has been [wanting](http://raviudeshi.com/15/06/ios-9-osx-11-new-apple-tv#phone-calls) this for a long time. This would make the user experience way better. I absolutely hate it when a phone call comes right when I'm watching a video, and right at the climax, a phone call comes from a person that I really don't want to talk to at the moment.

**"Because I have Caller ID"** Let's find a way to block spammers. I have the app, [TrueCaller](https://www.truecaller.com/), and that enables me to block out telemarketers and spammers. But, I don't feel comfortable giving access to this app. Apple has a way with privacy, so let's make it happen!

**Video/Live Photos Profile Picture for Caller ID:** This is one way that Apple can beat out Google. Google just came out with a pre-video call feature that shows the receiver of the call what could be going on in the background, sometimes convincing people to pick up the phone. Although, that could be a privacy concern. To replace that without a privacy concern, we can add videos or even live photos as Caller IDs, to add expression to the pre-pickup phase.

#### Miscellaneous

**Sports App:** This one is for all the sports junkies. Wouldn't it be nice to have one app instead of a billion as an epicenter for all sports scores. This could eliminate other apps, like ESPN and Yahoo!, and sometimes save space in the phone. Although, we are not cutting these companies out completely! There could be a "connect" feature that allows people to use their Yahoo!, ESPN, NFL accounts to follow their favorite teams or their fantasy sports teams.

**Notifications for News App:** When the News app came out, I was ecstatic. But when I looked into it, it wasn't very impressive. I thought of it as another RSS reader, which I don't even use. When the update came out last year with the "For You" section, I loved it. Now, News should be taken to the next level. First of all, there should be notifications when breaking news is reported. Also, this eliminates thousands of other apps that give me news also.

**Radio app, yes sir!:** I have been wanting this for a long time. I listen to my local music station every morning as well as my local news station. It would be awesome to have one app that has a FM/AM station. It could eliminate apps like iHeartRadio (in some cases) and ESPN Radio.

**Let Google Maps take over lock screen:** This is important. I know many people who prefer Google Maps over the default Apple Maps. Enabling this could trigger a better user-friendly experience while navigating. But remember, Google is not the best if you are a privacy freak!

**Add Stickers in iMessage:** Stickers are the future for texting. Let's just take that for a fact. Many people, especially people from Asia, love Stickers. Stickers also adds a new level of emotion to texting. Adding stickers is the future for iMessage!

#### The Others

**Seconds function for Clock timer:**
- Make timing more specific (i.e 90 seconds timer).

**Complete Lockdown on Notes:**
- Helps keep everything private.
- Beat out *1Password

**Siri to the Mac!!!!**
- I know this is not an iOS feature, but it looks like Apple has FINALLY turned a corner. They are officially bringing Siri to the Mac. This is exiting. And to imagine, why didn't Apple think of this before. It's like Modern Warfare. You start firing bullets as soon as your enemy fires the first one[^3]. I hope that Apple does a good job on this.

_______

So here it is. My wishlist for the new iOS 10. Watch it today on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE_M8A5yxnLfW0KghEeajjw) and/or on the [Apple Developers](http://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2016/) website. If those two links don't work, [click here](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/). If you read carefully, I said the words user-friendly many times on purpose. I believe this WWDC will highlight user-friendly features for iOS and more.

There is nothing left to say but...

#### **Happy WWDC day!**



[^1]: And sometimes, where the biggest yawn takes place.
[^2]: Last one was in 2015, when Apple came out with the MacBook. It came out with a price starting $1,299! The most surprising thing is that it only came with one port. Along with that, it was a uncommon USB port! Hello Apple, light isn't everything.
