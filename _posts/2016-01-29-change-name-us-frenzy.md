Hello! After almost 2 years of blogging for NFL Frenzy, we have decided to do something big. Something that will improve this blog, and something that many other people will love. For the past two years, I have been blogging about the latest NFL news, and it has been great ride. Although, I have always wanted to blog about something else other than football, like politics (ahem... Donald Trump). Over the years, I have gained new interests. So, as of today, we are changing our name to...
<!--more-->
## U.S FRENZY!

This opens up a new door of opportunities. I can blog about politics, technology, show business, and more. This also means more people can come and read the stories I write about. For the last 2 years, amazing NFL fans read my posts and watch my videos. Now, other people with other interests can come and visit my blog.

Once again, the blog name is U.S Frenzy. The URL is [usfrenzy.tumblr.com](usfrenzy.tumblr.com).

Thank you all for your support and wish me good luck for the new, U.S Frenzy!
