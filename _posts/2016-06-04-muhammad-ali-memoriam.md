Two days ago, we lost amazing boxer named Muhammad Ali. He died Friday late night after he was hospitalized the day before. America lost a man that not only dominated the world of boxing, but inspired us to be "the Greatest" and that "Impossible is Nothing." So let's take a break from politics, and remember this amazing sports icon.

| Year | Event |
| ---- | ----- |
| 1942 | Ali was born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr., on January 17 in Louisville, KY. He was born to Odessa and Cassius Sr. |
| 1954 | After his bike was stolen, the police officer that he reported the crime to directs him to boxing trainer Fred Stoner. Over the next six years, Clay would win six Kentucky Golden Gloves championships, two national Golden Gloves titles, and two AAU crowns. |
| 1960 | (1) Clay wins the light-heavyweight gold medal at the [Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_Summer_Olympics) in Rome. After returning to his hometown, he was surprised by all the racism, including being refused service from a "white-only" restaurant, and then fighting with a white gang. After being disrespected, Clay throws his gold medal into the Ohio River. Subsequently, he turns professional and wins the first two fights of his career. |
| 1964 | Despite an undefeated record, Clay is the underdog in his championship bout with Sonny Liston. But Clay would always trash talk Liston, and eventually won the match. After the fight, Clay announced that he is converting to the Nation of Islam. |
| 1967 | Ali refuses induction into the U.S Army due to his [religious convictions](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/muhammad-ali-risked-it-all-when-he-opposed-the-vietnam-war_us_5751e545e4b0c3752dcda4ca). He enrages many Americans by saying he has no business fighting Vietnam. Consequently, he is found guilty of draft evasion, fined $10,000, sentenced to five years in prison, stripped of his WBA title, and his license to fight. Later he was released, but still restricted from fighting. |
| 1970 | Since there is no state boxing commission in Georgia, Ali found a loophole and beat Jerry Quarry in Atlanta. |
| 1971 | In March, he fights heavyweight champ Joe Frazier in [Madison Square Garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_of_the_Century). Frazier wins unanimous decisions. Three months later, the Supreme Court rules in his favor, reversing the draft-evasion conviction.
| 1978 | With a career record of 55-2, Ali loses his belt to 1976 Olympic champion [Leon Spinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Spinks) in a 15-round split decision. Spinks' reign comes to an end seven months later, as Ali wins back the title.
| 1979 | Ali announces his retirement on June 27.
| 1980 | Comes out of retirement to fight new heavyweight champion [Larry Holmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Holmes). He loses the match, and pays a toll with it. There was an estimated 125 punches against him in the 9th and 10th round alone. Eventually, he gets knocked out in the 11th round.|
| 1981 | Ali once again takes a hit, as he looses to Trevor Burbick. He eventually calls it a career, and hangs up the gloves for good, retiring with an 56-5 professional record.
| 1984 | Ali is diagnosed with [Parkinson's disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease). It is a neurological disorder that effects speech and physical abilities of a person, including slowness of speech. |
| 1996 | Ali carries the Olympic torch and ignites the cauldron in the beginning of the Summer Olympics in Atlanta. He is also given a second gold medal that he won in 1960 and threw in the Ohio River due to anger. |
| 2016 | Ali dies of septic shock at the age of 74. |

I got this timeline from [infoplease.com](http://www.infoplease.com/spot/malitimeline1.html)

Muhammad Ali's funeral will be held Friday, June 10th, at his hometown in Louisville. Bill Clinton, Billy Crystal, and Bryant Gumbel will be eulogists at Ali's funeral.

There's nothing left to say but to say Rest in Peace, Mr. Greatest of All Time. Remember, Impossible is Nothing...
