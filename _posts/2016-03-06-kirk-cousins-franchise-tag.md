This week was a relief week for Kirk Cousins, the Redskins organization, and the Redskins fan base. Super Tuesday was not only super for Donald Trump, it was super for Kirk Cousins. The Redskins announced at about one o'clock on Tuesday that they will non-exclusively tag Kirk Cousins, and got a huge payload to go with it. Cousins signed the contract on Thursday. The contract guarantees a 19.95 million dollars for one year. It is a little more than the Redskins wanted to give, but at the end of the day, you got a good quarterback that can save your team.

This year, the Redskins had a mediocre year with Kirk Cousins starting. In first few games, the Redskins were flat out, bad. With that, Kirk Cousins in the first six games had six touchdowns to eight interceptions. That was a horrible touchdown to interceptions ratio for a starting quarterback. But, after the Tampa Bay game (a.k.a: the "You Like That!" game), he has won 7 out of 10 games, with a 23:3 touchdown to interception ratio. Even though he was number one in completions in the NFL after the regular season, there was still some considering to do. You see, every game they won was against a team that was under .500. So the question was, is Kirk Cousins the QB of the future for this team?

### THE DEAL BREAKERS

After much consideration, Kirk Cousins was signed by the Redskins. There were many things that made the Redskins mind.
- **DRAFT PICK:** This is a big one. The Redskins have the 21st pick in the draft this year, and it would be quite hard to get a good QB. They pick very late in the first-round, and there are so many teams that need a QB, that there won't be any QBs left to pick.
- **THE MONOPOLY:** It is very hard to let go of Kirk Cousins right now. He has a very good career ahead of him, and the Redskins are not the only one that know that. The 'Skins know that if they let him go, other teams will offer him a great deal with much more money. With that, he might have a good squad beside him.
- **50/50:** With this good of a quarterback, risks are worth taking. Even though he beat underachieved teams this season, he might improve over this offseason, and maybe clinch a playoff berth once again.

With these things to consider, Kirk Cousins is the obvious choice. People may tend to disagree, but the Redskins, in my opinion, made a smart move drafting Kirk Cousins.
