Tonight is the Democratic debate in Flint, Michigan. Flint, Michigan is also the place where families live on bottled water.

### ISSUE TALK

Many issues will be discussed tonight, like always. Although, one issue will be the core of tonight's debate.

- **CONTAMINATION CITY:** Flint, Michigan, as I said earlier, is where families and people live on bottled water. Why? The water is contaminated with lead, which makes it almost impossible to do the dishes, bathe, and more. Many children have to live with this. Climate change has been a big part of this campaign, especially on the Democratic side. I believe that this issue will be discussed very deeply. I expect Hillary Clinton to win on this issue, as she is shown to express this thoroughly throughout her campaign.

One question that arises is, Will Bernie Sanders be in the race for much longer. He is proudly saying that he will take this all the way to the convention, but the question is: Will he have enough delegates to survive. I believe that the only way he can stay in much longer is if he uses his funds wisely. He is getting a lot of money from supporters, but not as much as Hillary Clinton. Clinton of course has a SuperPAC, which helps her big time, while Sanders does not.

I hope you watch tonight's debate! It's going to be a good one!
