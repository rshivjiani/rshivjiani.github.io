**BY: RAHIL SHIVJIANI - CHIEF COLUMNIST, U.S FRENZY**

Throughout this election, we have seen much talk about momentum. Republican presidential candidate, Marco Rubio, and Democratic presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders, are in the center of the conversation when it comes to momentum. When I watch CNN, the panel of political commentators always talk about 'this' candidate (usually Marco Rubio) is coming out of this part of the election strong, and they might do better next time.

After the Republican caucuses in Nevada, I watched the post debate show on multiple channels, including CNN and MSNBC, and I was completely baffled by what they were saying. It was preposterous that they were still talking about momentum. I mean, even though Rubio has come out of these elections at a strong third or second place, it is not turning into gold. Sometimes we have to ask ourselves, is momentum enough to win the nomination? Out of all of the four states that have already voted/caucused, Trump has one three of them. **THREE!** On top of that, the successful businessman won **45%** of Latino voters in Nevada.


### "TRUMPSANITY": WHY TRUMP CAN SWEEP THE NOMINATION NOW.
Donald Trump after the Nevada caucus turned the face of his campaign as he befuddled every expectation:

+	**Better than expected:** Before Nevada, he was polling at around [40%]([http://raviudeshi.com/2016/02/why-trump-will-win), and came out with a whopping 46%. You might ask, isn't that because Jeb dropped out? You have to remember that Bush was only at 1%!
+	**Evangelical voters:** Trump go 4 out of 10 evangelical voters in Nevada, which is bad news for Ted Cruz, as he shone with evangelical voters in Iowa. According to a NBC News/Politico [poll](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/01/trump-evangelicals-poll-218210), Trump earned the support nationally with white evangelical Republican voters at 37 percent, while Sen. Ted Cruz, who wins big with evangelical voters, is at 20 percent.
+	**Hispanic Voters:** He not only won big with Hispanic voters in Nevada with a whopping 45%, he is also doing substantially well nationally with Hispanics. Even though many Hispanic voters despise him, he still has the upper edge over most of the candidates. According to a recent Washington Post [poll](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/wapo-univision-poll-2016/en/), it shows **22%** of Latino voters as Trump for their first choice, and **28%** as his/hers first and second choice. The only person that is ahead of him is Senator Marco Rubio, who is holding strong with Latino voters at 34% for first choice, and a whopping 53% for first and second choice.
+	**Winning by a HUGE Margin:** This is pretty scary. He has won 35% in NH, 33% in SC, and a big 46% in NV. If Trump starts getting over 50%, it's all over.
+	**Endorsement Frenzy:** Trump has picked up endorsements from many governors, including former Alaska governor, Sarah Palin, former rival Chris Christie, and former Arizona governor, Jan Brewer. He has also picked up endorsements from U.S Senators, including Jeff Sessions from Alabama, and former Massachusetts senator, Scott Brown. He has picked up many other endorsements along the way from U.S Representatives, also. Even though he has a list of endorsements, he has one endorsement that put him in hot water. White supremacist and former Grand Wizard of the KKK, David Duke has endorsed Trump. In a interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, Trump claimed he didn't know anything about David Duke. Although, he has said in the past that David Duke was a bigot. Later that day, Trump disavowed Duke's endorsement, but still didn't lift him up. To claim that he didn't know who David Duke is in the interview, and say later that it was a earpiece problem makes people suspicious.

Many questions arise when this comes up:

+	Is it enough to change a few voters minds?
	+	Maybe.
+	Is the election in Nevada enough to change the decisions of the majority of the Latino population?
	+	Not likely.
	+	There are over 10 million Hispanic voters in the U.S, and from talking to some, they are quite offended by the way Trump has rudely stereotyped them as drug dealers and rapists.
+	Will it change non-Hispanic voters' minds?
	+	Not exactly. You see, Mr. Trump has insulted women, the disabled, and Muslims with ridiculous comments...
		+	**WOMEN** He has insulted many times in the past, present, and he may in the future. In this presidential race, he has insulted candidates and journalists. He has insulted former Hewlett-Packard CEO and former Republican candidate Carly Fiorina, where he stated, *"Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?!"* He later stated that he was referring to her persona, not her looks. He has also made comments on Megyn Kelly's menstrual cycle, and Hillary Clinton's marriage with former president, Bill Clinton.
		+	**THE DISABLED** He mocked former *New York Daily News* reporter, **Serge Kovaleski**, who suffers from [Arthrogryposis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthrogryposis). Trump mocked Kovaleski by impersonating him by wildly flailing his arms and imitating the unusual angle at which Kovaleski's hand sometimes.
		+	**MUSLIMS** This has been one of the most controversial topics in the Trump campaign. He has said many times that he will temporarily ban all Muslims out of the U.S until we find out a way to fix our foreign policy. Many Muslims that I have talked to have been highly offended in the fact that their religion has been highly discriminated in this free country. Honestly, isn't every immigrant's dream who is moving to the U.S to be free and have more opportunities.

That's what's holding Trump back. The way he insults is horrific, which makes voters think if we can have a "big mouth" in the White House. Even though he insults many people, he turns down insults that are directed towards him. A few weeks ago, he shut down a reporter that misquoted him on a question in a press conference. He always finds a way to win, whether it is on Twitter or at a Town Hall meeting.

Something else is holding Trump back. Ever since he entered the race, the GOP party has practically been in a Civil War. Even though he has picked up many endorsements over the last couple of weeks, the people who don't endorse him think he is (quoting Jeb Bush) the "chaos candidate". Think about it, this party has been divided ever since he entered. Even with that, he has his way to get his point across and get supporters.

During and after Thursday's debate on CNN, Trump and Rubio have been exchanging harsh words between each other, whether it may be at a debate or a town hall. Trump did his own regular insults, including imitating Rubio for his constant need for water and his tendency to sweat a lot. Rubio on the other side...


### WELCOME TO THE DARK SIDE: THE DARK SIDE OF MARCO RUBIO, AND WHY HE PROBABLY CAN'T WIN ANY MORE.
...Rubio has had his share of insults. He has constantly insulted and criticized Trump for his actions in the past, whether it may be him insulting people or his business experience. Throughout the past week, he has had rallies and town halls in Virginia, Alabama, and more. Throughout his rallies, he has insulted Donald Trump in many ways. He has read his misspelled tweets, called him a con artist, and more. Now, I feel that Rubio is desperate. If you insult your rival on their policy, that's politics. But, if you insult your rival based on their grammar or looks, that crosses the line. Even though he may be desperate, he shouldn't portray it. He should remain calm and keep his composure, which is what many voters are looking for. If he is handling his way like this right now, imagine what he will do if he is president and someone insults him. Will he read that person's tweets. OF COURSE NOT! This is one of many things that can hurt him. Here are a few:

+	**Robot Rubio:** Rubio's debate boo-boo hurt him significantly in New Hampshire. Where was projected to get 2nd place, he got a weak 5th place, letting John Kasich take home 2nd place. Now, Kasich is projected not to drop out until his home state, Ohio, votes on March 15th.
+	**Cruz'n Along:** Rubio's real competition is Senator Ted Cruz. Unless Ted Cruz loses in Texas on Super Tuesday, which is highly unlikely (based on the current polls), he will probably stay in the race a little longer. Cruz has been the best-funded candidate ever since Jeb Bush.
+	**No Home-Field Advantage:** As Ted Cruz said on Tuesday, "You need to win your home state to win the nomination." Well, Marco Rubio is doing the exact opposite of that. In some polls, Rubio is losing by 15 percent in Florida, which is his home state. If he can't win today, he will be 0-15. Even though he said he's not going anywhere, something has to change. Otherwise, he is not going to win.

So, while Rubio *might* be able to win a 1-on-1 race with Donald Trump, the chances are very unlikely. If Rubio can't act poised, forget about it. A future voter like me wants to see a candidate that acts poised when in danger, and solves his problems, instead of beating around the bush and insulting his way to the presidency.
