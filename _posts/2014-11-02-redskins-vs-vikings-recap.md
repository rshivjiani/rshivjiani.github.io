About 7 weeks ago, Steve Marriucci said on NFL network "We will find out who will be the starter as soon as RG3 plays in his first game coming back from the injury." Griffin only had 1 INT in the game, and played with fire in the first half, but failed to execute 3rd down conversions, and those miscues really costed them the game.

This was rough day for the 'Skins, starting with a bus crash earlier today and the Native American protest to change the name.

Logan Paulsen and Ryan Clark both left and came back in the game feeling good. They both are okay.

Keenan Robinson: The captain of the defense got a muscle spasm from the bus crash today, and was bothering him a little during the game.

The Vikings played a good game, mainly led by Teddy Bridgewater and Matt Asiata in the second half. Bridgewater finish the game with 26 comp, and 268 yards passing. Matt Asiata finished the game with fire in the second half with 3 TD's in today's game.

Redskins Coach Jay Gruden still keeps RG3 as the starter, but he might be benched if he does not do good next game. This might be 2012 all over again, because they are 3-6 going in to the bye, and they could win 7 straight,  like 2012.
