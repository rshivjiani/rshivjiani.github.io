Jay Gruden has announced at his NFL Scouting Combine Press Conference that they will go into the 2015 NFL season with RG3 as their starting QB. It may be a lucky break for RG3, but it is a make it-break it time for RG3. If he screws up, he may be in trouble for losing his job. The Redskinsâ€™ next option is Kirk Cousins, who has been a phenomenal **backup** QB ever since he played his first game against the Browns two years ago. Although, can he take on the pressure of being a full-time starter?
