I know I have not blogged for a while, but I'm still here.

RG3 is again, RG-Injury. In the first quarter of the home opener of the 2014 season, RG3 got a dislocated ankle injury. The other person who got hurt was DeSean Jackson. He suffered a bruised shoulder. He did not get carted away like RG3, but he was also ruled out of the game.

As per Jay Gruden, RG3 will have some tests, as well as an MRI. And D-Jax's return status will be evaluated day to day.

But in spite all those injuries, Kirk Cousins and Andre Roberts came out with a spectacular win. They stunned the Jags 41-10. They are now 1-1. They are tied with the Cowboys in the NFC East.  The defense played spectacular today, with total of nine sacks on Chad Henne. Ryan Kerrigan alone had 3 sacks. He now holds the Redskins franchise record for sacks in a game.

So, my prediction for the Redskins is that they will probably have an 8-8 season. They still have to learn the Jay Gruden playing style.

All 'Skins fans, just like me, are hoping that the Eagles lose against the Colts on Monday Night.

Hail to the Redskins!!!

Stay tuned for more of the NFL news.
