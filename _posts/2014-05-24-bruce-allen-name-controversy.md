Everybody knows about the controversy of changing the Redskins name. Citizens to Lawmakers have been urging to change the name. But whenever they tell the Daniel Snyder to change the name, what's Daniel's answer? No. It has been a confident and simple no for him.

Just recently, Sen. Harry Reid demanded a change. He supported every part of the franchise except of the name. When I heard about it, it thought that he should just worry about the real problems in the U.S, like the economy.

That talk went on, until Bruce Allen made a statement to Harry Reid. He sent a 3-page descriptive letter about the truth of the name. Here are some important points that he made in the letter.

- The term 'Redskins' originated as a Native American expression of solidarity.
- The logo was designed by Native Americans
- An overwhelming majority of Native Americans do not find the name offensive
- The vast majority of Americans are in favor of keeping the name.

These points are exactly what Bruce Allen wrote in the letter. You can go see the [full letter](http://files.redskins.com/pdf/letter-from-bruce-allen.pdf).
