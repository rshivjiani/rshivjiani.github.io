The competition still lies beyond the dog pound. One of the greatest QB battles in the NFL. It is a huge fight. Let me tell my thoughts of the battle of Manziel and Hoyer...

If I was Manziel, I would stop partying and start focusing. We all knew the drama on Independence Day, and Johnny was independent from football by going to Vegas. So Johnny, if you want the job, stop partying and start focusing.

So what do you think?
