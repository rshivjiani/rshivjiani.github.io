Well, it finally happened. Quarterback **Robert Griffin III** was released by the Redskins on Monday morning. This happened not long after Kirk Cousins was resigned by the Redskins. Kirk Cousins was resigned last Thursday for a whopping one year, 19.95 million dollar contract. Many people saw this coming after the season ended, but the question is, where will he go next?

Many teams have been reportedly interested in signing Robert Griffin III, whether it may be for a starting job or a backup job. To this date, the Eagles, San Francisco 49ers, and the Cowboys. Here is the team-by-team analysis.

- **PHILADEPHIA EAGLES:**
  - This may not be the best job for RGIII. Just recently, Sam Bradford's contract was extended to a two year, 36 million dollar contract. So, if the Eagles have that much faith in Sam Bradford, it is unlikely for Griffin to get the starting job, unless he competes very hard throughout the offseason.
- **SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS:**
  - This might be a good place for RGIII. If Colin Kaepernick moves on from the 49ers after a bad season, then RGIII might try to go to San Francisco, so he can have a new, fresh start. He would have Chip Kelly as a coach, which is pretty good as he has played against him in college and the NFL. Although, if he can't get the job here, then if I'm RGIII, I wouldn't mind if I was a backup.
- **DALLAS COWBOYS:**
  - This option has been open for a very long time. Jerry Jones has been looking for a great backup (like Kirk Cousins) for Tony Romo that can boost up their team, especially after last season's debacle. Jerry Jones has a history of welcoming backups, so going back home to Texas wouldn't be a bad place to start.
- **CLEVELAND BROWNS**
  - RGIII has a great opportunity here. As the Browns have no star quarterback, so here could be his time to shine. Although, the Browns don't have many weapons, so I don't know how he would do there.

This is going to go on for a while, though. RGIII still has to settle down after his release. I think he would make a good quarterback with a coaching staff that let him be himself (a running quarterback) and a good team around him, especially with a good offensive line.
