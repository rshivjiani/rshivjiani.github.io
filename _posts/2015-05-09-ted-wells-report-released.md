Well, as some of you know, the Ted Wells Report has been deflated. It has said that some of the New England Patriots team, including QB Tom Brady, was ‘generally aware’ of the deflated footballs in the 2015 AFC Championship game against the Colts. Report shows that QB Tom Brady will be suspended by Roger Goodell next week.

Well, what does that mean for the Patriots. It all comes down to the commissioners call. If he is significantly suspended, can the Pats win with backup QB, Jimmy Garoppolo? And also, who else will face consequences in the Pats organization?

Whatever happens, I know it is going to have a big impact on this Patriots team. We’ll keep you updated as soon as we get more info about the consequences they may face.
