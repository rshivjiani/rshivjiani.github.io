Former FSU QB Jameis Winston threw 102 passes at the FSU Pro Day this afternoon, and there were mixed messages. For instance, in the easy, lobbing passes, he was on the money, but he made some mistakes. And those mistakes might cost his draft ranking. He was not really feeling it when it came to pressure. He quote “I tried to do to much.” He was not relaxed and he didn't complete his passes as much when he was under pressure. He still did very good, according to some coaches and scouts. As per a source, the he drew attention to the Bucs and the Titans. We are almost certain Winston is going to the Bucs, but anything could happen. In my opinion, he did better passing wise in the combine than the pro day, because he was more of himself in the combine.
