As the Draft approaches, one quarterback is on almost everybodyâ€™s mock draft going to the Bucs, and the other is like the king and the teams are acting like beggars. **Jameis Winston** is looking like he is going to Bucs, but **Marcus Mariota** may be going to the Bucs also, as he is going to work out for them, as per a source. He is also working out for the Jets, Chargers, and meeting with the Redskins, as per a source. Stay tuned, because I will be posting my 1st Mock Draft of 2015 soon.
