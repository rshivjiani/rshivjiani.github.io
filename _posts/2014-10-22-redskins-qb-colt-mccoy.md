**This is an outrage, seriously**.

The Redskins have just won their **SECOND** game this whole season. The QB's have been changing so much this season. From RG3's injury, to Kirk Cousins poor performance. It has been an outrage on how many broken bones that RG3 has had and Now, this is our only hope, <!--more-->**Colt McCoy.** He did remarkably good last week against the Titans, but let's see if he does good against the 6-1 Dallas Cowboys, Monday Night at 8:30 ET on ESPN. It will be more pressure against the defense than the offense. They have to put their amazing run defense against the #1 running attack, led by DeMarco Murray. I think this will be a great game on MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL.

Go 'Skins!!!
