Wow... It's been over a year since the first candidate entered the election. Since then, we have had 21 candidates eliminated, 21 debates, and 2 conventions. And tonight, we see the two candidates the people have chosen as their nominee face off on a political stage together for the first time. Although, this debate will be indeed different. It is projected to have more viewers than the record high, 80 million for Reagan v. Carter. And this showdown will have some decide who are they going to vote for this November for president. In this article, I will talk about the airing information of the debate and the ingredients to victory for both candidates.

### Why is this so HUGE?

The buzz is on, but why? Here are some reasons...

- First of all, there have never been candidates like this before. In one corner, you have the first female presidential nominee. In the other corner, you have a person who no one would think would get this far.
- They are in dead heat! According to recent polls, they are both neck-and-neck with each other.
- They have a big rivalry. I hope everyone still remembers Donald Trump's name calling. His famous nickname, "Crooked Hillary," has stuck with him for as long as he created it. And in the other corner, we got Hillary accusing Donald Trump's judgement and attitude.

All in all, this debate, no matter who wins, will go down in the history books.

### Ingredients to Victory!

#### Donald Trump

Donald Trump has two personalities. One is the off-the-bat, no script kind of Trump. And the other one is the calm and collected Trump (a.k.a: Teleprompter Trump!). Some say he has to pick one, but does he? To all the politicos and pundits out there, there is something called compromise. Here are some ingredients to victory for the two-sided man.

- Keep it controlled. What I mean by that is to don't try to make this the Comedy Central's *The Roast.* Stay focused on the issues, and hit Hillary on her standpoint on the issues.
- Don't attack the moderator. In the past, Trump has hit Lester Holt as a biased Democrat, even though he is a registered Republican.
- Scandals. Hit Clinton on the scandals. The Trump Campaign has sent out a link via. Text Message today morning asking supporters to vote on which scandal he should pound on Hillary. Whatever it may be, we will see it in the debate tonight!

#### Hillary Clinton

Hillary Clinton has made history. She is the first female presidential nominee, and that says a lot. ALTHOUGH, there have been many scandals against her. One to mention is her email scandal, which has been going on for months now. So, to win this debate, she has to...

- Pound Trump on HIS scandals, like the Trump University case.
- Try to trigger Trump. Bring out the monster inside of him, as I like to say. One point that Clinton has been hitting Trump on his off-the-bat kind-of character.
- Do all of that, but keep focused on the issues. Issues like national security, public affairs, and the economy.
