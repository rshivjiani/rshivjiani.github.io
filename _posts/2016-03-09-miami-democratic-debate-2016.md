**RAHIL SHIVJIANI / MARCH 9, 2016**

This debate is going to be like non other. This debate is going to matter severely for both candidates. This debate is going to be...  good. In this article, I will talk about how to watch the debate, the airing information about the debate, and what will we see tonight.

### ISSUE TALK

Many issues will be discussed in tonight's debate, like always. Although, one issue would be the core of this debate.

- **IMMIGRATION IDEAS:** Since the main host of tonight's debate is Univision, I believe the main issue of tonight's debate would be Immigration reform. This has taken over much of this election, mainly on the Republican side of this race. Also, much of the audience for tonight's debate is going to be Hispanics, so the candidates have to appeal to the Hispanic voters. I don't really know who is going to win this debate because it is going to be a hard-hitting debate on both sides.

### WHAT TO EXPECT

We will see many things in this debate, whether it could be about the past, present, or future. Here are some things.

- **FEEL THE BERN:** This has been a big topic this week. Bernie Sanders has over performed in the polls in the last week, which has shrunk the lead for Hillary Clinton. We will see if Bernie Sanders can keep his lead in tonight's debate based on the things he says.
- **CLINTON SCANDAL:** Clinton's email scandal speaks for itself, no more words.
- **TRADE:** Trade has become a big topic throughout this race, both Republican and Democrats. I want to see what Hillary Clinton says about free trade and how Bernie Sanders' trade policy relates to Donald Trump.
- **HEALTH CARE:** This has become a big topic on the Democratic side. Bernie Sanders wants Health Care to be free to all people, while Hillary Clinton wants the existing Affordable Care act to be continued.

________________________________

This will be the last debate on the Democratic side, and it is going to be a good one! The debate frenzy doesn't stop just today, though! Tomorrow, the four remaining Republican candidates are going to face off in tomorrow's GOP debate on CNN. Happy Watching!
