title: "The 3 New Kansas City Chiefs of 2014"

The Draft has passed and teams have given out their projected starters for 2014. When reading the projected on NFL.com, I thought that there could be 3 teams that could be the 2014 Kansas City Chiefs. The 3 teams that are the "turnaround" teams are ...

**The Jaguars, the Browns, and the Buccaneers.**

I thought these 3 teams are the new Chiefs because they were all smart during Free Agency and/or the Draft. The Jaguars were not really alive during free agency, but very alive during the draft, finally picking a QB, (Blake Bortles). The Browns were also not very alive in free agency, but they didn't need to, because they grabbed Johnny Football and Justin Gilbert. With new OC, Kyle Shanahan and new coach, Mike Pettine, they will be a great offense.

The Buccaneers were alive both Free Agency and the Draft. In free agency, they grabbed Josh McCown, which had amazing stats when he backed up for Jay Cutler. He needs receivers though. When he was in Chicago, he had Alshon Jeffery and Brandon Marshall. And he has 2 receivers too in Tampa. He's got veteran Vincent Jackson and rookie Mike Evans from Texas A&M.

Well, there you have it. Do you think I am right?
