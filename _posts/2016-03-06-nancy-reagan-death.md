#####***- NANCY REAGAN***
______

Today was a very sad day in Washington. Today, we mourn upon the death of former First Lady, **Nancy Reagan**. She died at her home in Los Angeles of congestive heart failure. She live a great 94 years as an actress, a First Lady, and a lover. She was most known for loving and supporting her husband and 40th President of the United States, Ronald Reagan, who she called "Ronnie". She not only loved Ronald with all her heart, she supported him during his 10-year battle against Alzheimer's.

When Nancy was in the White House with her husband, she helped lead the campaign, "Just Say No." As some people know, this campaign helped kids and teens stay off drugs.

She will rest next to her husband in Simi Valley, California, at the Reagan Memorial Library. Now, she is with her beloved, "Ronnie", in heaven, and may she rest in piece. God Bless America.
